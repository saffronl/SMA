# Simple-Moving-Average

Coded the Simple Moving Average in Python using data fron the API Quandl and graphed using MatPlotLib.
Added a Buy Signal for when the short-term moving average crosses the longer-term moving average, and a Sell Signal when the longer-term MA crosses above the shorter-term MA - This is called the crossover strategy in finance.
